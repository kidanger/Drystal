Drystal 1.1
===========
December 24th 2014

Version Classy Sea

Graphics:
    added drystal.colors
    Postfx:
        removed 'dither'
        renamed 'red' to 'multiply'
        add 'pixelate'
        power of 'distortion' is now a parameter
    new_sprite is now easier to use
    removed set_point_size, draw_point now takes a size parameter
    implemented draw_point_tex, which can be used to draw small images with low overhead
    renamed create_postfx to add_postfx
    removed use_buffer, added use_default_buffer; same for shader

Physics:
    renamed physic to physics (for example, update_physic has been renamed update_physics)
    added pixels_per_meter ratio, this simplifies body position and size manipulation
    added get_center_position
    added GearJoint, FrictionJoint
    added any/all/closest/farthest methods for raycast, so you don't have to define your own callback
    bodies and joints can be destroyed during physics update
    if a body is destroyed, its joints are destroyed too

Audio:
    implemented music looping
    added onended callback for music
    added pause and set_volume for music
    added pitch manipulation for musics and sounds

Particle:
    added set_texture, to replace colored squares by images
    added a quantity parameter for 'emit'

Event:
    added constants (BUTTON_LEFT, BUTTON_RIGHT, BUTTON_MIDDLE, WHEEL_UP and WHEEL_DOWN)
        which are assigned to 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 so both methods are valid
    replace resize_event by page_resize
        it is only available for web builds and is mainly used to update the fullscreen mode

Truetype:
    added constants (ALIGN_LEFT, ALIGN_CENTER and ALIGN_RIGHT)
        which are assigned to 1, 2 and 3
    enhanced rendering quality by using the NEAREST filter

Net:
    module entirely removed (too instable and very few use cases)

General:
    added table.print, math.distance, math.clamp, math.aabb, math.inside
        these are general purpose functions
    added drystal.new_timer
    added man pages
    improved error reporting (stackback trace)
    more errors are thrown when the API is misused
    proper exit when out of memory
    new demos repository: https://github.com/kidanger/drystal-demos.git
